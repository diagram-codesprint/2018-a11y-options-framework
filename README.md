# a11y-options-framework

“The idea of adjustable site options to support user preferences and personalized accessibility has a long history and several mature manifestations, such as the Fluid Project’s User Interface Options. However, current solutions can be heavyweight in terms of their dependencies and setup, requiring the adoption of particular frameworks or libraries. I’d be interested to experiment with building a very lightweight accessibility options framework without any external dependencies using only modern browser capabilities to manipulate CSS, with the goal of both increasing the ease of adoption of this concept and better behavior in performance-restricted contexts such as low-bandwidth.”
